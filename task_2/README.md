# Bioinformatics - Individual Assignment 2
Solution to the second individual assignment for the Bioinformatics course at FCUP 23/24. The final report that was turned in is contained in the file [solution.pdf](solution.pdf). The code for the third part of the assignment is contained in the file [solution.py](solution.py).

## Usage
Script requires the `sequence_alignments.py` file from the fifth lab of the course to be in the same directory.

## Output
The script will output the following information about the sequence alignment for both global and local alignment:
- The score matrix
- The traceback matrix
- The optimal alignment score
- The optimal alignments
- Whether there are multiple optimal alignments

## Issues
The code from the fifth lab was modified to take into account the possibility of multiple optimal alignments.
